## Introduction

This project is a simplified Kotlin compiler implemented in Haskell. The primary goal is to showcase compiler construction techniques using functional programming. The compiler is divided into three main components:

- **Lexer**: Handles lexical analysis and converts input source code into tokens.
- **Parser**: Analyzes the tokens based on grammar rules and constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Main Program**: Manages the compilation process, integrating both the lexer and parser.

## Project Structure

### Files

- **Lexer.x**: Defines the lexical analysis using `Alex`, a tool for generating Haskell lexers. This file specifies regular expressions to identify different types of tokens. The lexer handles:
  - Whitespace and comments.
  - Reserved keywords (`val`, `var`, `if`, `else`, etc.).
  - Identifiers, operators, and literal values (integers, strings, etc...).

- **Parser.y**: Implements the parsing logic using `Happy`, a parser generator for Haskell. The parser defines:
  - Grammar rules that specify the valid structure of Kotlin code, including statements, expressions, and control structures.
  - The construction of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which represents the hierarchical structure of the input code.
  - Error handling mechanisms to report syntax errors with expected tokens.

- **Main.hs**: The main Haskell module that ties the lexer and parser together. It:
  - Reads the input source code.
  - Uses the lexer to generate a list of tokens.
  - Passes the tokens to the parser to build the AST.
  - Outputs the resulting AST to a file and prints it for inspection.

- **ast.txt**: Contains the output of the AST after parsing a sample input. This file is used for debugging and verifying the correctness of the AST generation, and building a hierarchical structure of the code we provided in the terminal.

- **trabalho.cabal**: Configuration file for the Haskell Cabal build system. It manages project dependencies, compiler options, and build settings, ensuring that all necessary libraries and tools are included.

## Setup and Compilation

### Prerequisites

- `Haskell-GHC`.
- `Alex` for lexical analysis and `Happy` for parsing.
- `Cabal` to manage the dependencies 

### Building the Project

1. Configure your `file.cabal` to install all needed packages and dependencies
2. On your terminal type `cabal build` thus, building the project

### Running the Compiler

The compiler reads Kotlin source code from standard input, processes it through the lexer and parser, and outputs the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST provides a structured representation of the input program, which can be used for further stages like semantic analysis or code generation.

How to run the project - On your terminal type:
```
cabal clean
cabal run

``` 
You don't need to do cabal clean everytime, but it's a good practice to do it, since it cleans leftover files from cabal build

## Implementation Details

### Lexer (`Lexer.x`)

- Uses regular expressions to define token patterns.
- Handles whitespace, comments, keywords, identifiers, and literals.
- Generates tokens such as `TokenVal`, `TokenVar`, `TokenIf`, and `TokenElse`.
- Provides a streamlined way to identify and categorize parts of the Kotlin source code.

### Parser (`Parser.y`)

- Defines the grammar rules for a subset of the Kotlin language.
- Uses the tokens produced by the lexer to build the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- Supports basic Kotlin constructs, including variable declarations, assignments, control flow statements, and expressions.
- Implements error handling to provide feedback on syntax issues during parsing.

### Main Module (`Main.hs`)

- Acts as the entry point for the compiler.
- Imports the lexer and parser modules.
- Reads input code, applies the lexer to tokenize it, and then parses the tokens to generate the AST.
- Outputs the AST for debugging and verification purposes.

## .hs files

`Lexer.hs` and `Parser.hs` files can be found here:\
**For the Lexer.hs:**\
`dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-9.4.8/trabalho-0.1.0.0/build/Lexer.hs` 
**For the Parser.hs:**\
`dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-9.4.8/trabalho-0.1.0.0/build/Parser.hs`.

## Error Handling

- **Lexer**: Skips invalid characters and handles unrecognized tokens gracefully.
- **Parser**: Provides clear syntax error messages, including line numbers and expected tokens, to help with debugging.

## What can't our project do?

We implemented a few more things than the ones that were asked by the professor for the project, but things like: For loops, arguments on main function or class declarations don't work. 

## Things that went wrong

As in every project not everything goes according to plan, and this project was no exception. In the beggining we had a few headaches configuring the .cabal file, and problems with the newly added `build-tool-depends`.

After we managed to configure the files, fixing Parser errors was a pain, since there was no concrete display of the exact error.

We defined a few things in the beggining just to make it work and down the line it was a problem, and we had to redo them.

## Future Improvements

- Extend the parser to support a wider range of Kotlin features, such as functions, classes, and advanced control structures (if needed).
- Implement semantic analysis to check for type errors and other semantic issues in the input code.
- Add a code generation phase to produce executable code.
- Improve the error reporting mechanism to provide more context and suggestions for fixing syntax errors as it was quite difficult to understand/correct errors.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple Kotlin compiler using Haskell. It showcases the use of `Alex` for lexical analysis and `Happy` for parsing, integrating these components into a cohesive compilation pipeline. The current implementation handles a basic subset of the Kotlin language and lays the groundwork for further enhancements, such as semantic analysis and code generation.

This project comes with great value as it shows us a "behind the scenes" of what's happening when we casually write code.
